Version 0.18
    o Fixed bug affecting the function negate() when the SOP expression contains
      a single condition in one of the conjuncts / products
      (thanks to Michael Baumgartner for the report)
    o Fixed bug in asNumeric() preventing certain character objects of class
      "haven_labelled" to be converted as numeric
    o Improved function stopError(), printing error messages containing newline
      characters
    
Version 0.17
    o More robust support for multi-byte locales when detecting tilde and
      dash operators
    o Fixed bug in possibleNumeric() for objects of class 'declared'
    
Version 0.16
    o New functions agtb(), altb() and aneqb() to test (in)equality of floats
    o New utility function getName() to return the name of the object being
      used in a function call
    o Fixed bug when recoding objects of class 'declared'
    o Fixed bug detecting multibyte strings
      
Version 0.15
    o possibleNumeric() and asNumeric() are now more robust in situations
      with invalid multibyte strings
    o Argument "cuts" renamed to "cut" in function recode()
    o Fixed bug in function recode() that prevented creating ordered
      factors
      
Version 0.12
    o Solved bug in function translate() when called from plumber or
      callr (thanks to Trevor Strobel for the report)
    o Solved bug in dealing with expressions containing brackets with
      single letter conditions and no star signs to indicate conjunctions
    o New functions list.rda() and names.rda()
    o Small improvement of the recode() function

Version 0.11
    o New function finvert(), to invert a factor's values (and optional
      its levels)
    o New function frelevel(), an improved version of the base relevel()
    o New function permutations()
    o Improved version of combnk(), to cover input vectors of any type
    o Improved error trapping for functions negate() and simplify, when
      dealing with multivalue expressions
      
Version 0.10
    o Minor, internal functionality changes
      
Version 0.9
    o Solved bug in translate() recognizing column names for datasets with more
      than 27 columns (thanks to Sophia Birchinger for the report)
    o New function export(), moved here from package QCA
      
Version 0.8
    o Extended functionality to other types of vectors, such as having the 
      class "haven_labelled"
    o Novel way of recognizing SOP expressions, even without quotes
    o New utility function recreate() to facilitate substitution

Version 0.7
    o Minor modification in function simplify(), to avoid the check error
      from the CRAN servers for the OS X platform

Version 0.6
    o Major modification (and *not* backwards compatible!) with respect to
      denoting negations. Using upper and lower case letters for presence and
      absence is no longer supported, a tilde being the only and the default
      method to signal a negation (thanks to Charles Ragin for making the point)
    o Removed deprecated argument "use.tilde" from all related functions
    o All functions treating a DNF/SOP expression now obey this major
      (and not backwards compatible) change denoting a negation. Upper
      and lower case conditions are no longer supported
    o All printing classes are now prefixed with "admisc", to avoid possible
      namespace collisions with (previous) versions of package QCA
    o New function invert() to convert a SOP expression to a POS expression
      (thanks to Charles Ragin for the suggestion)
    o New function expand() to perform a full or a partial Quine expansion
      to a SOP expression

Version 0.5
    o Functions compute(), factorize(), intersection(), negate()
      and simplify(), moved here from package QCA
    o New function replaceText()
    o Minor changes to internal functions getInfo() and getLevels()
    o Improved function translate() using replaceText(), now better
      suited in dealing with set names of variable number of
      characters, including space
    o As a result, argument "snames" from function venn() can deal with
      spaces in set names (thanks to Andre Gohr for the suggestion) 

Version 0.4
    o Fixed small printing bug in possibleNumeric()
    o Function translate() is now more robust against non-printable
      characters

Version 0.3
    o Function combinations() renamed to combnk()
    o Improved function possibleNumeric() to deal with objects of
      class "haven_labelled"

Version 0.2
    o Function combinations() renamed to combnk()

Version 0.1
    o Start of the package
