Version 0.6
    o Major modification (and *not* backwards compatible!) with respect to
      denoting negations. Using upper and lower case letters for presence and
      absence is no longer supported, a tilde being the only and the default
      method to signal a negation (thanks to Charles Ragin for making the point)
    o Removed deprecated argument "use.tilde" from all related functions
    o All functions treating a DNF/SOP expression now obey this major
      (and not backwards compatible) change denoting a negation. Upper
      and lower case conditions are no longer supported
    o All printing classes are now prefixed with "admisc", to avoid possible
      namespace collisions with (previous) versions of package QCA
    o New function invert() to convert a SOP expression to a POS expression

      suited in dealing with set names of variable number of
      characters, including space
    o As a result, argument "snames" from function venn() can deal with
      spaces in set names (thanks to Andre Gohr for the suggestion)
