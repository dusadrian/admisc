Version 0.8
    o Extended functionality to other types of vectors, such as having the 
      class "haven_labelled"
    o Novel way of recognizing SOP expressions, even without quotes
    o New utility function recreate() to facilitate substitution

Version 0.7
    o Minor modification in function simplify(), to avoid the check error
      from the CRAN servers for the OS X platform

Version 0.6
    o Major modification (and *not* backwards compatible!) relative to
      denoting negations. Using upper and lower case letters for presence and
      absence is no longer supported, a tilde being the only and the default
      method to signal a negation (thanks to Charles Ragin for making the point)
    o Removed deprecated argument "use.tilde" from all related functions
    o All functions treating a DNF/SOP expression now obey this major
      (and not backwards compatible) change denoting a negation. Upper
      and lower case conditions are now longer supported
    o All printing classes are now prefixed with "admisc", to avoid possible namespace
      collisions with (previous) versions of package QCA
    o New function invert() to convert a SOP expression to a POS expression
      (thanks to Charles Ragin for the suggestion)
    o New function expand() to perform a full or a partial Quine expansion
      to a SOP expression

Version 0.5
    o Functions compute(), factorize(), intersection(), negate()
      and simplify(), moved here from package QCA
    o New function replaceText()
    o Minor changes to internal functions getInfo() and getLevels()
    o Improved function translate() using replaceText(), now better
      suited in dealing with set names of variable number of
      characters, including space
    o As a result, argument "snames" from function venn() can deal with
      spaces in set names (thanks to Andre Gohr for the suggestion) 

Version 0.4
    o Fixed small printing bug in possibleNumeric()
    o Function translate() is now more robust against non-printable
      characters

Version 0.3
    o Function combinations() renamed to combnk()
    o Improved function possibleNumeric() to deal with objects of
      class "haven_labelled"

Version 0.2
    o Function combinations() renamed to combnk()

Version 0.1
    o Start of the package
