Description: Contains functions used across packages 'QCA', 'DDIwR', 'mixed' and 'venn'.
    Interprets and translates, factorizes and negates SOP - Sum of Products
    expressions, for both binary and multi-value crisp sets, and extracts information
    (set names, set values) from those expressions. Other functions perform various
    other checks if possibly numeric (even if all numbers reside in a character vector)
    and coerce to numeric, or check if the numbers are whole. It also offers, among
    many others, a highly flexible recoding routine.
